## Data Extraction

### Source of Data

Data is sourced from Spotify's API and a custom Python script generating fictional values for song streams and downloads.

Data Extraction Code

#### User-Followed Artist Data

```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth
import json

def fetch_and_save_followed_artists(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope):
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(
        client_id=client_id,
        client_secret=client_secret,
        redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
        scope=scope
    ))

    all_artists = sp.current_user_followed_artists(limit=20, after=None)

    with open('followed_artists_list.json', 'a', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        artist_info = all_artists['artists']
        json.dump(artist_info, file, ensure_ascii=False)
        file.write('\n')

def main():
    # Replace <your_client_id>, <your_client_secret>, <your_redirect_uri> with your actual Spotify application credentials
    client_id = "<your_client_id>"
    client_secret = "<your_client_secret>"
    redirect_uri = "<your_redirect_uri>"
    scope = "user-follow-read"

    fetch_and_save_followed_artists(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope)
    print("Done")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Albums and Tracks

The Albums and Tracks data extracts occurs similarly. 

![Album Data Ingestion](img/albums_ingestion_pipeline.PNG)

#### 1. Copy ArtistIDs

- Extracts ArtistIDs from a SQL database and stores them in a delimited text file on Azure Blob Storage.

#### 2. Validate Token

- Executes a pipeline ("pl_get_token") to validate and obtain an authentication token.

#### 3. Capture Token

- Captures the authentication token obtained from the "Validate Token" step.

#### 4. Set Artist ID Index

- Sets the initial artist ID index to 0.

#### 5. Until Album Ingest Notebook Success

- Loops until the Databricks notebook ("Ingest Albums") successfully runs.
- The notebook is parameterized with the captured token and artist ID index.

![Album Data Ingestion 2](img/albums_ingestion_pipeline2.PNG)

#### 5. Ingest Albums

- Executes a Databricks notebook to ingest albums data, using the captured token and artist ID index.

#### 6. Get Error Log

- Retrieves error information if the "Ingest Albums" step fails.

#### 7. Copy Log

- Copies error logs to another dataset for further analysis.

#### 8. Delete From Blob

- Deletes data from the original error log storage if specific conditions are met.

#### 9. Get Response

- Retrieves the response code from the error log.

#### 10. Get ArtistID Index

- Retrieves the current artist ID index from the error log.

#### 11. If Response Code 429

- Checks if the response code indicates a rate limit exceeded.
- If true, waits for a specified time, refreshes the token, and updates variables accordingly.

#### 12. If Response Code 401

- Checks if the response code indicates unauthorized access.
- If true, refreshes the token.



## Data Transformation

### Album Data

I systematically transformed Spotify followed artist data by processing individual artists, handling associated genres, and establishing relationships between artists and genres. I utilized Spark for efficient large-scale data processing and incorporated runtime measurements to assess the processing times for different stages.

#### Sample Script:

```python
for line in lines:
    # Load JSON data from the line
    all_artists = json.loads(line)

    # Iterate over each artist in the loaded data
    for artist in all_artists['items']:
        artist_count += 1
        
        artist_name = artist['name']
        artist_id = artist['id']
        artist_followers = int(artist['followers']['total'])
        # Create a Spark DataFrame Row
        artist_row = Row(ArtistID=artist_id, Name=artist_name, Followers=artist_followers)

        # Append the Row to the artist DataFrame
        df_artist = df_artist.union(spark.createDataFrame([artist_row], schema=artist_schema))
        # Extract artist genres
        artist_genre = artist['genres']
        #unique_genres.update(artist_genre)
        print(f"{artist_count}:{artist_name}")
        
        # Process genres using Spark operations
        for genre_name in artist_genre:
            genre_data.append(genre_name)      
    
    
    print('-----------------------------------------------------------------------')

# Convert genre_data to a set to get distinct values
distinct_genre_data = set(genre_data)
# Create a mapping of genre names to GenreID
genre_id_mapping = {genre: i + 1 for i, genre in enumerate(distinct_genre_data)}
# Create a list of Row objects for the DataFrame
genre_rows = [Row(GenreID=genre_id, Name=genre) for genre, genre_id in genre_id_mapping.items()]
# Add the rows to the existing df_genre DataFrame
df_genre = df_genre.union(spark.createDataFrame(genre_rows, schema=genre_schema))

# Record the end time
main_end_time = time.time()
# Calculate the total runtime
total_run_time = main_end_time - main_start_time

# Convert the elapsed time to minutes and seconds
minutes, seconds = divmod(total_run_time, 60)
# Print the runtime
print(f"Total runtime: {int(minutes)} minutes and {round(seconds, 2)} seconds")


```

### Album Data

![Album Data Transformation](img/transform_album_data.PNG)

##### 1. Source Data Extraction (Two Instances):

- Extract data from a source with a specific structure, described by the schema.
- The source data includes information about albums, with various attributes like album type, artists, release date, etc.

##### 2. Derive Artist ID:

- Use a regular expression to extract the artist ID from the source data's 'href' field.
- This is done for both instances of source data.

##### 3. Flatten and Select Relevant Columns (Two Instances):

- Flatten the data structure to make it more suitable for further processing.
- Select specific columns like AlbumID, AlbumName, AlbumType, ReleaseDate, and TotalTracks.
- This is done for both instances of source data.

##### 4. Standardize Dates:

- Check the length of the 'ReleaseDate' field. If it's four characters, assume it's a year and standardize it to '01/01/{year}'.
- This is done to ensure a consistent date format.

##### 5. Aggregate Distinct Rows:

- Group data by 'AlbumID'.
- For each group, keep the first row as distinct, discarding duplicates.

##### 6. Sink Data (Two Instances):

- Load the processed data into two separate sinks (destination systems).
- The 'AlbumSink' receives data from the 'SelectReqFiles' transformation.
- The 'ArtistAlbumSink' receives data from the 'SelectAlbArtID' transformation.


### Track Data

![Track Data Transformation](img/transform_track_data.PNG)

#### 1.	Source Data Extraction:

- Extract data from a source named "GetTrackJsons" with a specific schema, including fields like 'href', 'items', 'limit', 'next', 'offset', 'previous', and 'total'.
- Allow schema drift and disable schema validation.

#### 2. Derive Album ID:

- Use a regular expression to extract the album ID from the 'href' field.
- Name this derived column as 'AlbumID'.
- This operation is performed using the 'DeriveAlbumIDColumn' transformation.

#### 3. Flatten and Select Relevant Columns:

- Flatten the data structure to make it more suitable for further processing.
- Select specific columns like 'SongID', 'TrackNumber', 'Title', 'duration_ms', and 'AlbumID'.
- This is done using the 'FlattenJSON' and 'SelectReqFields' transformations.

#### 4. Convert Duration to Seconds:

- Derive a new column named 'DurationInSeconds' by converting 'duration_ms' to seconds.
- Use the 'ConvertDurationToSeconds' transformation for this operation.

#### 5. Update Required Fields:

- Select and rename columns to match the final desired structure.
- Columns include 'SongID', 'TrackNumber', 'Title', 'DurationInSeconds', and 'AlbumID'.
- This is achieved using the 'UpdateReqFields' transformation.

#### 6. Sink Processed Data:

- Load the processed data into a sink named "TrackSink," which is associated with a dataset reference named "ds_processed_track_sink."
- Allow schema drift, disable schema validation, and specify umask, preCommands, and postCommands configurations for the sink operation.

### Weekly Data

![Weekly Data Transformation](img/transform_weekly_data.PNG)

#### 1. Source Data Extraction (Two Instances):

- Extract data from two sources named "GetWeeklyJSON" and "GetWeeklyJSON2," both associated with the same dataset reference named "ds_weekly_data_raw."
- The source data includes information about songs, with attributes like 'song_id' and 'weekly_data.'

#### 2. Flatten and Select Relevant Columns (Two Instances):

- For the first instance:
  - Flatten the nested structure of 'weekly_data' to make it more suitable for further processing.
  - Select specific columns like 'WeekID,' 'SongID,' 'WeekStartDate,' 'WeekEndDate,' and 'WeeklyStreams.'

- For the second instance:
  - Flatten the nested structure of 'weekly_data' again.
  - Select specific columns like 'WeekID,' 'SongID,' 'WeekStartDate,' 'WeekEndDate,' and 'TotalWeeklyDownloads.'

#### 3. Sink Processed Data (Two Instances):

- Load the processed data into two separate sinks.
  - The "StreamSink" receives data from the first instance's transformation.
  - The "DownloadSink" receives data from the second instance's transformation.

## Workflow Automation

The pipeline operates with two triggers, adding a layer of automation to the overall process. The first trigger initiates the creation of the database when the file containing followed artists' data is placed into Blob Storage. 

``` bash
{
    "name": "tr_followed_artist_data_arrived",
    "properties": {
        "description": "The \"tr_followed_artist_data_arrived\" trigger is a Blob Events Trigger that triggers the \"pl_execute_all\" pipeline when new blobs are created in the \"/followed-artist-data/blobs/followed_artists_list.json\" path within the specified Azure Storage account.",
        "annotations": [],
        "runtimeState": "Started",
        "pipelines": [
            {
                "pipelineReference": {
                    "referenceName": "pl_execute_all",
                    "type": "PipelineReference"
                }
            }
        ],
        "type": "BlobEventsTrigger",
        "typeProperties": {
            "blobPathBeginsWith": "/followed-artist-data/blobs/followed_artists_list.json",
            "ignoreEmptyBlobs": true,
            "scope": "<your_subscription>",
            "events": [
                "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The second trigger is activated at the end of each week when the weekly song data (streams and downloads) is received. This subsequent trigger facilitates the execution of specific ETL processes, updating the respective tables for weekly streams and weekly downloads

``` bash
{
    "name": "tr_weekly_track_data_arrived",
    "properties": {
        "description": "\nThe \"tr_weekly_track_data_arrived\" trigger is set to activate the \"pl_weekly_streams_pipeline\" when new blobs are created in the \"/incoming-streams/blobs/\" path of the Azure Storage account.",
        "annotations": [],
        "runtimeState": "Started",
        "pipelines": [
            {
                "pipelineReference": {
                    "referenceName": "pl_weekly_streams_pipeline",
                    "type": "PipelineReference"
                }
            }
        ],
        "type": "BlobEventsTrigger",
        "typeProperties": {
            "blobPathBeginsWith": "/incoming-streams/blobs/",
            "ignoreEmptyBlobs": true,
            "scope": "<your_subscription>",
            "events": [
                "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Weekly Data ETL

After the database is created we put together the weekly streams and downloads etl pipeline. This is to be ran each sunday when new simulated weekly data is genereated into blob storage.

![Weekly Data ETL](img/weekly_data_etl.PNG)

To Generate weekly data i just wrote a Python script that defines a function called generate_weekly_data. This function generates simulated weekly download and stream data for a provided list of songs. To accomplish this, I used the datetime, timedelta, numpy (as np), and json modules. For each of the 52 weeks in a year, the script randomly generates mean and standard deviation values for downloads and streams for each song. Then, it generates random numbers following a normal distribution based on these parameters.

The script formats the data, including the week number, start and end dates, total weekly downloads, and total weekly streams. It saves this information for each song in separate JSON files, with one file for each week. I've also included two auxiliary functions: get_week_dates, which determines the start and end dates of a given week, and write_to_file, which writes data to JSON files.

I adopted this approach because Spotify does not provide streaming and download numbers for individual songs on their platform. They only offer aggregate data for an artist's top 5 songs or so. This script serves as a workaround to simulate and generate the desired data.

**Sample Code:**

```python
def generate_weekly_data(song_list):
    # Get the current year and week
    current_year, _, _ = datetime.now().isocalendar()

    for week_number in range(1, 53):
        weekly_data = {"songs": []}

        for song in song_list:
            # Generate random mean and standard deviation for downloads and streams
            downloads_mean = np.random.uniform(30000, 70000)
            downloads_std = np.random.uniform(10000, 30000)

            streams_mean = np.random.uniform(400000, 800000)
            streams_std = np.random.uniform(150000, 300000)

            # Generate random numbers for downloads and streams using a normal distribution
            total_weekly_downloads = int(np.random.normal(downloads_mean, downloads_std))
            total_weekly_streams = int(np.random.normal(streams_mean, streams_std))

            # Ensure the generated numbers are non-negative
            total_weekly_downloads = max(total_weekly_downloads, 0)
            total_weekly_streams = max(total_weekly_streams, 0)

            # Get the start and end dates of the week
            start_date, end_date = get_week_dates(current_year, week_number)

            # Append the data to the weekly_data list
            song_data = {
                "song_id": song,
                "weekly_data": {
                    "week": week_number,
                    "week_start_date": start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
                    "week_end_date": end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
                    "total_weekly_downloads": total_weekly_downloads,
                    "total_weekly_streams": total_weekly_streams
                }
            }

            weekly_data["songs"].append(song_data)

        # Save data for each week separately
        write_to_file(weekly_data, f'weekly_data_week_{week_number}.json')
```

```python
# Rest of your code remains unchanged
def get_week_dates(year, week_number):
    start_date = datetime(year, 1, 1)
    start_of_week = start_date + timedelta(days=(week_number - 1) * 7 - start_date.weekday())
    end_of_week = start_of_week + timedelta(days=6)
    return start_of_week, end_of_week

def write_to_file(data, file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=2)
```



## Challenges Faced

During the development of the ETL pipeline, I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and adaptability. While the specifics might not be remembered in detail, I can outline the general types of challenges faced:

### Authentication with Spotify API

The challenge of integrating OAuth for user-followed artist data extraction led to a thoughtful solution. Utilizing the spotipy library in Python, I implemented a local extraction process. This involved initiating the OAuth flow locally, authenticating the requests, and obtaining the necessary data from Spotify. The extracted data was then conveniently transferred to Azure Blob Storage, creating a bridge between the local extraction process and the broader Azure environment. This approach not only addressed the initial hurdle posed by Spotify's OAuth control flow but also provided a seamless transition for the data to be ingested into the Azure ecosystem. The use of the spotipy library played a crucial role in simplifying the authentication process, showcasing the adaptability and resourcefulness employed during the development of the ETL pipeline.

### Efficient Handling of Album and Track Data

The efficient ingestion of album and track data became a focal point during the development of the ETL pipeline. Initially relying solely on Data Factory's web activities for ingesting albums and tracks proved to be inefficient, especially when dealing with a substantial number of artists and their entire discographies.

### Recognizing the Challenge

As the project evolved, I encountered a significant challenge related to the request limits imposed by Spotify's API. While Spotify's documentation mentioned a 429 error for too many requests within a rolling 30-second window, practical testing revealed that I consistently reached this error after approximately 5000 requests per endpoint. This limitation posed a substantial hurdle, especially given the extensive list of 121 artists for whom I aimed to retrieve entire discographies.

### Addressing the Challenge

In response to this challenge, I pivoted to using Azure Databricks as it offered a more scalable solution. However, the request limit persisted, and I needed a strategic workaround to ensure the complete extraction of data without encountering the 429 error regularly.

### Implementing a Retry-After Solution

Within Azure Data Factory, I implemented a Retry-After solution. Upon reaching the request limit, I configured the pipeline to wait until the specified retry-after time period had elapsed, which, in this case, was approximately 24 hours. This strategic approach allowed the extraction process to resume after the waiting period, effectively bypassing the limitations imposed by Spotify's API.

### Navigating the Lack of Bulk Track Endpoint

One noteworthy challenge was the absence of a bulk track endpoint in Spotify's API. Given the absence of such an endpoint, the Retry-After solution became a pragmatic choice to manage the data extraction process for a considerable number of artists. This adaptive approach to handling API limitations and leveraging the Retry-After solution demonstrates the practical considerations made during the development of the ETL pipeline, highlighting problem-solving skills and resourcefulness in the face of real-world challenges.

### Learning Curve with New Technologies

Working extensively with Databricks, Azure Data Factory, and OAuth control flow presented a steep learning curve. However, this challenge was tackled through dedicated learning and hands-on practice.

## Conclusion

In achieving my goal of creating a project entirely within the Azure ecosystem, I successfully developed a functional pipeline to the best of my current knowledge. The project's primary outcome was the creation of a working music database, extracted from Spotify's API and supplemented with fictional streaming and download data. While the pipeline is operational, I recognize the potential for ongoing improvements and expansions. There is ample room for enhancement, and envisioning the addition of user profiles and playlist generation is a promising avenue for future development. Such expansions could open the door to addressing business-related queries, aligning with the schema established within the database. The project, as it currently stands, serves as a foundation, and there are numerous possibilities for growth and refinement.
