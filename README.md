# ETL Pipeline for Music Database

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this ETL pipeline is to reinforce the foundational data principles acquired through self-study, my master's program and practical internship experience. Drawing on the knowledge and skills developed, the project aims to apply these principles to the real-world scenario of building a music database. By extracting, transforming, and loading data from Spotify's API, the pipeline serves as a hands-on application of data management concepts. This project is a steppingstone to solidify my understanding of data processing, analytics, and storage.
## Prerequisites

## Scope and Goals

The scope of the project encompasses the end-to-end process of constructing a music database, starting from the extraction of artist data from Spotify, including details like discography, albums, songs, followers, and genres. The goal is not only to create a functional ETL pipeline but also to deepen my understanding of Microsoft Azure, a key technology in the contemporary data landscape. Achieving this involves successfully implementing and optimizing the data pipeline, incorporating Azure services as needed. The overarching objective is to gain practical expertise in designing, building, and maintaining an effective data pipeline, contributing to my overall proficiency in the realm of data engineering and analytics.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### A. List of Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory:** For orchestrating workflows
- **Azure Dataflows:** For efficient data transformations
- **Azure Databricks:** For advanced processing capabilities
- **Azure SQL:** For detailed analysis, utilizing Azure's relational database service
- **Tableau:** For visualizing and reporting insights
- **Python scripting:** For specific functionalities

### B. Justification for Selecting Each Tool

My decision to exclusively utilize Azure services stems from a deeply personal motivation â€“ the pursuit of the Azure Data Engineering Associate certification. By immersing myself in Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Databricks, and SQL, I ensure seamless integration within the Azure environment. This strategic choice aligns with the specific objectives of the certification, contributing not only to a comprehensive understanding of Azure's data services but also to the practical application of this knowledge within a real-world project.

Before running the ETL pipeline, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install spotipy  # Python library for Spotify API
# Add other dependencies as needed
```
## Data Extraction
### Source of Data
Data is sourced from Spotify's API and a custom Python script generating fictional values for song streams and downloads.

Data Extraction Code

#### User-Followed Artist Data

```bash
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth
import json

def fetch_and_save_followed_artists(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope):
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(
        client_id=client_id,
        client_secret=client_secret,
        redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
        scope=scope
    ))

    all_artists = sp.current_user_followed_artists(limit=20, after=None)

    with open('followed_artists_list.json', 'a', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        artist_info = all_artists['artists']
        json.dump(artist_info, file, ensure_ascii=False)
        file.write('\n')

def main():
    # Replace <your_client_id>, <your_client_secret>, <your_redirect_uri> with your actual Spotify application credentials
    client_id = "<your_client_id>"
    client_secret = "<your_client_secret>"
    redirect_uri = "<your_redirect_uri>"
    scope = "user-follow-read"

    fetch_and_save_followed_artists(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope)
    print("Done")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Albums and Tracks
